# SharedChain Cooperative Proof

SharedChain uses an efficient cooperative proof to secure the chains.

* Each sub-chain writes its current hash to the shared chain on a routine basis.
* There is now way to forge a chains signed hash, only omit it.
* We use an inexpensive, internal automated audit process to ensure cooperative nodes are keeping an accurate chain.
