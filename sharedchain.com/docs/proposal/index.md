# SharedChain Proposal

SharedChain will enable the next stage in global cooperative economies. Using smart contracts with Bitcoin integration, internal and external business agreements can be defined, funded, tracked and paid. All automatically, and all with complete transparency, while still protecting the privacy of the individual.

Weâ€™ll create a global decentralized network of cooperatively managed servers that enable organizations to define, fund and staff their projects. Using end-to-end encryption, smart contracts can be embedded in SharedChain and used to automate complex workflows across organizations and across borders with payment made in Bitcoin.

Anyone can run their own SharedChain server for their organization's internal and external use. To maximize the value, they can join aggregate chains, which may be open or closed and may include a fee. Anyone can run an aggregated chain using the same open source server software.

SharedChain has been designed to minimize its carbon footprint. The first step is in using an efficient cooperative proof. We implement WASM servers that use half the resources of Docker. The servers can also be deployed on Arm64 architecture to maximize energy savings.

SharedChain is aimed at global development teams, our own development team is split between developers in Europe and the US. We will meet all European privacy laws, including GDPR.
