# SharedChain Proposal

SharedChain will enable the next stage in global cooperative economies. Using smart contracts with Bitcoin integration, internal and external business agreements can be defined, funded, tracked and paid. All automatically, and all with complete transparency, while still protecting the privacy of the individual.

It will create a global decentralized network of cooperatively mananged servers that enable organizations to define, fund and staff their projects. Using end-to-end encryption, tasks and activities are defined and stored on an immutable internal blockchain.

Smart Contracts can be embedded to automate the the flow of work. These contracts can integrate with the Bitcoin blockchain to fund work and perform payments.

Our development team is split between devolopers in Europe and the US. We will be complying with all European privacy laws including GDPR.


Unlike many blockchain solutions, we donâ€™t require more electricity than a small country to operate. We've made conscious decisions to minimize the carbon footprint of the project:

* Efficient WASM servers use half the resources of other container options.
* Deployable to energy efficient Arm64 servers.
* Secured with an electricity sipping Cooperative Proof.
