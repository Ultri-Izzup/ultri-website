## Database

### Database Functions

The API user only is only allowed to call a set of defined functions. It should never create raw SQL queries.

[Database Functions](/technical-docs/database/functions/)

[Local Database Backups](/local-db-backups/)

## Assets

Assets are inputs.

## Artifacts

Artifacts are outputs.

## Nuggets

[Nuggets](/technical-docs/nuggets/) are the "standard box" that all data fits into so we can easily add a lot of functionality around that data, without duplicating our efforts.

## Platform

The platform is any part of this technology solution.

## Reactions

[Reactions](/technical-docs/reactions/) represent a members' response to a [nugget](/technical-docs/nuggets/). We still need to define the set of reactions.
