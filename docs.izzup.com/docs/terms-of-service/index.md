# Terms of Service

Izzup.com is a service provided by [Ultri](https://ultri.com).

Ultri is a one-person company 100% owned and administrated by Brian Winkers. Besides me, Brian Winkers, there are no other company employees. I will single-handedly conduct the provision of this service and have access to the stored data. I will not share any stored data or even look into it unless strictly necessary in cases of suspicious activity or technical problems.

All installations will be made using the base Firefish repository and the data centers where I host all servers are from AWS. You can find more about AWS terms of service [here](https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/).

The plans include a reasonable, normal usage of Firefish as a social media platform. If I identify that your account is being used for other purposes or abusing the service, I will close your account.

The same goes for any illegal activity. Please use common sense. You know what illegal is. I want to help you run a Firefish server but can't do it if you break the law.

* Sexual content involving minors, including artistic depictions

Anyone found violating the terms of service will be warned, asked to leave Izzup.com or suspended, depending on the gravity of the violation. Still, those services will have access to download a backup with everything needed to migrate to a different hosting solution.

Currently, Izzup.com service is in open Beta. Meaning the service is still being developed, optimised and tested. Izzup.com service is provided "AS IS" and offers no warranties.
