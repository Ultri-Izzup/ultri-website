# Developing a Quasar/Vue3 site app

## Prerequisites

There are a few common tools required for development, you may already have them installed.

[View Prerequisites](/developer/frontend/quasar/prerequisites/)

The only one currently is the app that runs at www.ultri.com.

## Install modules

We use `yarn` with our Quasar apps for maximum compatability with upstream.

```sh
yarn install
```

## Start 

```sh
quasar dev
```

## Test Build

```sh
quasar build
quasar serve dist/spa
```
