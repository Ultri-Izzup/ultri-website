# Defining Organizations in Ultri

Organizations of all sizes should take the time to define how they view themselves, and their goals. This helps make sure everyone is on the same page and pulling in the same direction. This is especially important for a startup where each misstep eats up precious runway.

## Mission Statement

### Definition

A mission statement provides a single point of guidance, and should define your place in the market.

### Usage

When there is tension around how to address drivers, you should be able to look to the mission statement for guidance.

### Tuning 

An organization mission shouldn't change often, we suggest you review your mission statement yearly. This process should include input from as many stakeholders as possible.

## Drivers

### Definition

Drivers are the forces that your organization must address to achieve its mission, these can be internal or external.

### Usage

Drivers identify obstacles or strategies that the organization should focus their efforts around.

### Tuning

These needn't change often, some may be evergreen and applicable for the life of the organization. Others, especially external ones, may be forced upon the organization.

## OKR

### Definition

OKR stands for Objective and Key Results

#### Objectives

Objectives define clear measurable goals that are seen as the most effective way address the drivers. 

#### Key Results

Key results provide an unambiguous means to measure the results, this is a critical step in the feedback loop. It is important to be able to quantify and qualify that you are on the correct path.

### Usage

These should be set at the organizational level first and then set cooperatively with each sub-group. Each sub-groups objectives should cascade from the parent, and work toward achieving the parent's objective. The parent groups needs to agree that the objectives and key results are valid measures of the success. It is essential that the sub-group is committed to the plan and feels they "own it".  The child groups success will be measured by their own key results.

#### Objectives

Objectives define clear measurable goals that are seen as the most effective way address the drivers. It is good to have some objective that are a reach, but most should be set reasonably.

#### Key Results

Key results may be a binary result or something with a range of possible values. It is best to not have only binary results. For any result, it is useful to be able to track your progress toward the goal as you go. You want the shortest fedback loop you can get.  

### Tuning

OKR are generally defined on a quarterly. They may need to be revisted more often if the related drivers change in importance. The new OKR definitions can be cascaed down from the top, and then reviewed and accepted from the bottom up.
