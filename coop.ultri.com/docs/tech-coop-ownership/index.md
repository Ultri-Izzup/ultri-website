# Ultri Co-op Ownership Model

Our co-op seeks to provide stable, affordable software for end-users, as well as meaningful jobs for developers. It does this by making the user and developers the owners, cutting out all the bureaucratic middlemen and VC profiteers usually involved.

**Build It - Use It - Own It**
