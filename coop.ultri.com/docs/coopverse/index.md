# A better Fediverse, an Ultriverse.

## The Problem

* No solid funding plan
* Myriad of connection options
* Unclear federation rules, differnt hosts blcok differfent things.
* Starting an alternative is hard you need to reach critical mass.


## The Solution

A co-op owned "coopverse".

### Revenue

* We charge $20/mo and provide $15 of metered usage (storage, bandwidth, compute)
* Posts to the coopverse are charged based on options and their cost (boost, expiry, indexing)
* We place ads on the public pages, this allows us to collect non-member revenue.

### Profit sharing




## Features

* Invite only, invitee recorded on acceptance.
* Members inviting too many bad actors will be booted.
* Less trolls, $20/mo is an effective deterrent to someone having hundreds of accounts.
* Less memes, we can tax them.
* No corp oversite, the members own it, and decide who, if anyone, should ever be blocked.
